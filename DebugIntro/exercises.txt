DebugIntro

FloatSums.c : 	This code prints a variety of values found by summing floats. 
	In particular it sums small numbers onto a larger one. 
	Check what difference it makes to change eg_float to a double. What sort of value for init then makes the error a similar size to the array elements?

Overflow.c: Overflows and Epsilon
	This code does some overflowing calculations, and then tries to store large integers into floats
	
	Try swapping eg_int for long and/or eg_float for double.
