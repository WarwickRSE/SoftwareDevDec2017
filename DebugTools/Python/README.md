Python example code and exercise sheet for Introduction to Debug Tools

These examples are intended to be run using the debugger, 
so instead of being simple scripts they all have a `main` function.
You can run them using

`import {programname}

  {programname}.main()`

To run them using the debugger, use e.g.

`import pdb

pdb.run("PDB_eg1.main()")
`

The later examples also have working versions in the directory Solutions

<!---Finally, there is a piece of "real" code in the RealExample directory. This also has bugs. Try and diagnose them.-->
