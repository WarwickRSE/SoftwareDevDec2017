C example code and exercise sheet for Introduction to Debug Tools

Compile the examples with
  `cc -O0 -g {name} -o {outputname}`
For example
  `gcc -O0 -g 09_Tarpit.c -o 09`

Remember the `-g`!

Run inside the debugger using `gdb ./09` or similar

The later examples also have working versions in the directory Solutions

Finally, there is a piece of "real" code in the RealExample directory. This also has bugs. Try and diagnose them.
