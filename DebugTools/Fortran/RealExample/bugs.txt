This is diff output. The first block (with <) is the buggy version, the second (with >) is working

First bug:
56c56
<   values(1,:) = 1.0
---
>   values(0,:) = 1.0
This means that values(0, :) is completely uninitialised

Second bug:
62c62
<   CALL display_result(temp_values)
---
>   CALL display_result(values)
temp_values hasn't been set at this point, so we print some nonsense

Third bug:
66,67c66,67
<     DO iy = 1, ny-1
<       DO ix = 1, nx-1
---
>     DO iy = 1, ny
>       DO ix = 1, nx
The top and right cells will never contribute, so the solution is wrong. No debugger will tell you about this!!
